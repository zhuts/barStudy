## Liquidated Damages

An LD clause in a K is a R dmg estimate in the event of a party's breach. The amount fixed in that clause must be proportionate to any actual loss and also the party enforcing the LD clause must be able to show that dmgs would be difficult to precisely calculate.
> Example
> 1. a contractors delay in completeing a construction job in a "time of the essence" K.
> 2. breach in a lease of a fleet of trucks
> 3. when a biz is sold and seller breachs non-compete

LD clauses avoid difficulty and expense of having to prove dmgs
<!-- (00:09:45) -->
A breaching party can oppose the enforcability of an LD clause by showing either
1. dmgs would not be difficult to prove
2. the LD amount is grossly disproportionate to any foreseeable dmgs, thus rendering the LD as a 'penalty' which is against public policy

Where a K provides for both actual dmgs and LD then the LD clause becomes a penalty that can not be enforced

To determine if the LD amount is reasonable, Rst and UCC examine the amount in light of the harm anticipated when the K was executed as well as the harm at the time of the K breach by looking at the actual loss suffered. Under this approach, eventhigh the amount initially fixed in the K may have been a penalty, it is nevertheless enforceable if, after the breach, that amount is not unreasonable in light of the P's actual dmgs.

Even if the court voids the LD clause as a penalty, the non-breaching party can still recover any actual and consequential dmgs caused by the D's breach

A K's LD clause does not automatically preclude injunctive relief or specific performance unless the clause expressly states that LD is the sole and exclusive remedy

## Punitive Damgages

PD are not intended to compensate a P, but to punish a D and deter others from similar reprehensible, quasi criminal conduct. A breach of K is simply an economic decision by the breaching party and is not considered so morally reprehensible as to warrant punitive dmgs. 

## Exculpatory Clauses

An EC in a K is the opposite of an LD clause. It allows the parties to allocate the risk of economic losses by limiting liabilty for breach

> Example  
> a moving company limiting its liability to $.30 per pound of each item damaged

Liability clauses are strictly construed and must be conspicuous and must be expressed in clear and unambiguous language. Rst K states that a clause that afixes an unR small amount may be unenforceable as unconscionable, but a term fixing an unR LD is unenforceable on grounds of public policy as a penalty

EC clauses frequently are inserted in burglar and fire alarm service K. Some states require the word 'negligence' be used in order to exculpate a party from its own negligence. 

> Example  
> "the parties release any and all claims against D"

This example would not fly in many states because it does not use the word 'negligence'

Public policy forbids waiver of liability for negligence for intentional or reckless conduct

## Equitable Remedies

The primary equitable remedies are injuntion (PILE) and specific performance

### Specific Performance

An SP judgment is a court order compelling the D to perform according the breached K.

Under FR70, when a Fed Ct grants a J for SP or Replevin but the D refuses to comply with ct order, then if the property is within the district where the ct is sitting, it can simply enter judgment transfering title directly from D to P, and for specific performance of real property that J is entered in the realty's chain of title. If the property is located outside the district, the ct can appoint a 3rd person to transfer title. In addition, D can also be held in contempt.

To successfully obtain SP, the P must show:
1. the subject matter of the suit is unique
> Example  
> irreplaceable chattel  
> any real property
2. when money dmgs are not an addequate remedy. money dmgs are inadequate when subject matter can not be replaced by recovering $

In K that do not involve the sale of realty, the deciding factor for SP are:
1. the uncertainty of the ct fixing dmgs
2. weighing the relative hardship of each party if SP is or is not granted by ct (relative hardship theory where cts will "balance the equities" before granting SP)

traditionally cts have not granted SP on:
1. K to lend or borrow $ because the P has an adequate remedy at law
> borrower can borrow money from bank and sue D for $+interest 
2. Construction K, but Rst K permits it
3. K clause allowing a party to seek SP. cts will not enforce such a clause and excise. K clause prohibiting SP will be enforced by courts
4. Personal service K even though services involved are unique because of
    * a) difficulty ct will have in enforcing quality of the performance
    * b) 13th amendments prohibition against involuntary servitude
(p46#24) 
<!-- 00:50:00 -->
Generally parties can put into a K whatever terms are agreed to but PLUS terms (mneumonic 21)

# Covenants Restricting Competition
## 1. An express non compete K restricting the employee from competing with the employer after quiting or being fired for cause

the restriction can not be any broader than necessary for the protection of the employer's legitimate biz interest

Courts use the TISSUE(mn K #22) test to determine whether to enjoin the employee from competing:
### T - Time must be R, usually 2 years or less
### I - Inability of employee to work elsewhere. Court looks at hardship imposed on employee
### S - Space - the geographic Space of the restriction can only be as broad as needed to protect employer's interest
### S SUE - Services Special Unique Extraordinary -  employees Services must be Special, Unique, or Extraordinary
equity will not enjoin an ordinary employee becase of the absence of SUE services. where an SUE employee is fired without cause, then the non-compete clause will not be enforced. Likewise under the if the employer makes the working conditions so intolerable that an R person wouldn't work such that the SUE employee quits, courts treat it as though was fired

## 2. Implied in law restriction preventing current and former employees from disclosing an employers confidential 'trade secrets'
where an employee takes trade secrets to a competitor, courts may enjoin injunction actual or threatened disclosure of the trade secrets

A 'trade secret' is a formula, process, customer list, scientific or technical info that provides advantage over competitors who do not have it. An employer must take R precautions to safeguard the secrecy of a trade secret from public disclosure. 

If the info is generally known or readily available then it can't be a trade secret. 

Under the inevitable discovery rule, where a former employee had access to a trade secret such as strategic plans on marketing, distribtution, or pricing, and that employee now has similar responsibilities with a competitor then cts will conclude that it's inevitable disclosure will occur and the ct will issue an injunction

WHen a business is sold, then an express covenant prohibiting 

## 3. When a biz is sold, then an express covenant prohibiting the seller from competing with the buyer should be expressly made part of the transaction
The length of time and the geographic area in which comp is prohibited must be R, and the ct will enforce that restriction to the extent necessary to protect the buyer's interest in the purchased biz.
<!-- 01:09:00 -->
## 4. Goodwill of a biz
Goodwill of a biz is an intangible asset that may be purchased from the biz of the buyer. Goodwill is the purchasers right to expect that existing biz customers will continue to patronize the biz. when the 'goodwill' of a biz is sold, there is an implied in law covenant that the seller will (forever) not solicit former customers of that business, but former customers are always free to return to a seller's knew biz as long as they weren't solicited by the seller.

> problem  
> a popular veterinarian biz and its goodwill was sold to B buyer who was subsequently convicted of pedo. This breach of implied condition of good faith that the seller would refrain from any conduct that would impair the value of goodwill

many K involving celebrities include a 'morals' clause that allow termination in the event of scandal, immorality, domestic violence, or anything that would embarass the employer of the celebrity

### Right to fire an employee

if an employment K fails to include a "definite fixed duration" then the law presumes it is employment at will and the employee may quit or be fired at anytime for any legal cause or no cause at all. The discharged employee has no claim for breach because the K contained no period of a "definite duration" 

### Employee Disloyalty
(p16#9)
AN employee can not act in a manner inconsistent w/ duty of good faith and loyalty owed to employer. If this duty is breached then the FAITHLESS EMPLOYEE must account to the employer for any secret profits as well as support salary/commissions paid by employer during period of disloyalty
<!-- 01:24:00 -->
# Sales UCC art 2

Art 2 of UCC governs all K for sale of goods

CL K rules continue to apply in a sales of goods K to the extent they are not displaced by art 2

goods are defined as all things which are moveable at the time of identification to the K for sale

the term 'goods' includes growing crops or timber, reagrdless as to whether the seller or buyer removes them from the land. also includes minerals (gravel, coal, sand, etc) or even a structure, but only if it is removed from the land by the seller. If the buyer is to remove it, then that K is governed by RP law and not UCC art 2. 
<!-- 1:33:30 -->
under the predominant factor test when a K involves both goods and services, art 2 applies to entire K if the K is predominantly for the sale of goods and the services are secondary
___
## terms to know

### Merchants
the code frequently sets higher standards on persons that are merchants and define thems as persons who:
1. regularly deal in goods of that kind, or
2. by their occupation hold themselves out as possessing knowledge or skill concerning goods involved in the transaction

almost every person in biz is deemed to be a merchant however the implied warranty of mechantability is only given by merchants who regularly deal in goods of that kind

the code imposes an obligation of good faith on K parties which requires both subjective honesty of each party and the observance of objective standards of fair dealing

### Tender of Delivery
Tender is the seller's act of placing and holding conforming goods and then giving the buyer any necessary notification of the seller's readiness to perform under the K terms to enable the buyer to take delivery. The time, place, and manner are determined by the parties K and the provisoins of art 2.
___
An action for breach of a sales K must be commenced after the CoA accrues. Breach of warranty claims accrue on the date seller first tenders the goods except where the seller's warranty expressly extends to the future performance of the goods (eg "5 years or 50k miles") which gives the buyer time to discover the breach within the extended period. The SoL on such extended express warranty claims accrues when the breach is or should've been discovered during the warranty period, not from the date of tender. 

___
## Perfect Tender Rule

The PTR permits buyer to reject goods and sue for breach of K if the seller's goods or tender fail to conform to the K in any respect (quantity, quality, timeliness of seller's delivery)
### excepitions
PTR does not apply to **ICOP** (mne K p5#23)
<!-- 2:00:30 -->
### I - Installment K
An installment K is one in which seperate lots are to be delivered and seperately paid for and accepted

A buyer can reject an installment only if the non-conformity "substantially impairs" the value of that installment, and the non-conformity can not be repaired/cured. A buyer can not reject an installment for trivial defects. Courts use Rst K HAIL (mne K p2#9) factors (used to tell if breach is substantial) to help determine whether a substantial impairment exists.

A buyer can sue the seller to recover dmgs due to the non-conformity of one installment but can not treat the entire K as breached unless a non-conformity in one or more installments "substantially impairs the value of the whole K" (very rare)

remember that in a similar non-sales divisible K the performing party does not have to prove substantial performance of the entire K to recover for any divisible portion of the K that has been performed

### C - Commercial Impracticability

delay or non-delivery will be excused if performance was made impracticable by an event that was not perceived by the parties when they entered the K

performance is not impracticable if it requires a significant cost increase. It is only impracticable if the loss is grossly disproportionate to any conceivable loss

### O - Objective and R belief that goods would be acceptable to the buyer

If a seller, in good faith:
1. sends non-conforming goods objectively and R believing that such goods would be acceptable to the buyer, and
2. when notified of the non-conformity the seller indicates to the buyer its intentions to cure breach, then
3. the buyer must give the seller additional R time to tender conforming goods even beyond the date fixed in the K

If the buyer does not give the seller this additional R time to cure but instead invokes PTR and repudiates the K based on seller's breach then it is the buyer who has wrongfully breached the K (narrowly interpreted)
> example  
> updated OS on computers when buyer actually wants the prior version, inferior OS

### P - Prior to the date for performance in the K seller delivers conforming goods and the buyer rejects the goods 
if the seller seasonably notifies the buyer of its intention to cure and cures the tender before performance date expires
___
the UCC has modified the CL technical rules of offer and acceptance by stating that, unless otherwise unambiguosly insisting on a specific type of acceptance, a uniltaral or bilateral K offer can be accepted by a promise or performance

Under the UCC a seller can accept a buyers offer by (1-3)
1. a return promise accepting the offer
2. shipping conforming or non-conforming goods
3. by beginning performance, provided the buyer is given notice within a R time

thus a seller who ships goods to a buyer cuts off the buyers right to revoke offer even though the seller never communicated an acceptance to the buyer prior to the buyer's attempted revocation

shipping non-conforming goods constitutes an acceptance but also gives rise to a buyer's CoA for breach of K

if a seller notifies the buyer and intentionally ships non-conforming goods as an accomodation (courtesy) then seller is not liable for breach

___
## Battle of the Forms

An Offeree can do 3 things with an offer:
1. accept
2. expressly reject, or
3. accept certain terms of the offer but add additional or different terms. Such an acceptance is a counteroffer (implied rejection) which can be impliedly accepted by buyer if the buyer accepts the goods when they are shipped. This is refered to as the **Last Shot Doctrine** because the terms of the last doc control the terms of the K once the delivered goods werre accepted, creating a binding K

This unfairly gives the sender of the last form the power to rewrite the K.

UCC art 2 changed this through the Battle of the Forms doctrine , which arises from the usual biz pratice of sending and receiving unread purchase order forms. Under UCC art 2, a K can arise from an acceptance containing different or additional terms if the doc is a **definite and seasonable (timely) expression of acceptance**

For every BotF problem, ask yourself 2 questions:
1. was there a definite and seasonable expression of acceptance? if yes
2. what are the terms of the K?
<!-- 02:52:44 -->
Additional terms in a definite and seasonable acceptance (or memorandum confirming an oral agreement) become part of the agreement unless **OCAN** (mne K p5#24)
