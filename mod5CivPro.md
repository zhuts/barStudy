# Provisional Remedies

The purpose for using a PR is to maintain the status quo prior to final J. Usually PR is requested by a P, but a D can do so on a crossclaim, counterclaim, or an impleader complaint.

There are 6 traditional PRs. (**LIARRS**) Only the prelim injunction and the TRO are found in the fed rules. Fed cts use state law for the other LIARRS PRs (R64)

## L - Lis Pendens - notice of pendency. 
The purpose for filing a list pendance is to protect some interest claimed by P in the D's real property which interests could be cutoff if the D sells or mortagages the RP to a bonafide purchaser (BFP) prior to the P's judgement. Goes on title and alerts world of P's interest in realty. Not a lien but gives constructive notice and prevents BFP. interests acquire after lis pendens filed are subject to the P's ultimate judgement. Renders title unmarketable.

in order to file an LP, the judgement sought by P must directly divest D of ownership/use/possession of that realty.

An LP can not be filed where P is suing landowner for a $ judgement because money $ does not effect D's title to ownership/use/possession.

The procedure for filing LP is the simplest of PRs. Atty files a 1page doc in the county clerks office where realty is.

LP is only PR that does not involve SLOB 
### S - **Sheriff** is not involved
### L - no court review of the P's **Likelihood** of success on the merits
### O - no court **Order** is required
### B - no **Bond** has to be posted by P...unlike other PRs

## I - Injunction
preliminary injunction restrains D prior to final judgement. Seeks to prevent one party from harming another party's interestes during a lawsuit. used to maintain status quo

generally an injunction is not available where the P is suing D to collect $ and seeks the injunction to prevent D from moving assets outside of the state. Instead proper PR would be order of attachment

A PI is available:
1. when D's conduct threatens to destroy P's right in the subject matter of a lawsuit. EX prevent D from transfering/moving/destroying property that is subject of lawsuit.
2. in an action seeking a perm injunction

A prelim injunction or TRO will not be granted unless a P demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence **PILE** (CivPro handout p7#3)

### P - would the injunction harm **Public's** Interest or further it?
Here ct looks at how public would be effected by granting or denying the injunction. ex: environmental harm, or enjoining discrimination in P's place of employment/school. ex -  non-compete clauses. ex - trademark infringement where D is selling knock-off goods, public interest is well-served by injunction preventing such fraud
### I - **Irreparable** injury is occurring/will occur unless inj is granted

when the P is suing for K, P's harm is usually financial which can generally adequately addressed through money J, thus inj will not be granted

mere apprehension of irreparable injury is not sufficient. it must be shown that D's acts are occurring or threatened and likely to occur

irreparable injury: 
1. can not be repaired, such as a.loss of goodwill, reputation, trade secrets
2. where P can't be made whole by $
3. where money dmgs can't easily be fixed by ct (hard to determine) 

### L - substantial **Likelihood** that P will succeed on claim (a possibility, not probable)
### E - **Equities**, when balanced by the ct, clearly way in P's favor.
Here ct use comparative hardship theory by weighing harm against P vs harm to D. Ct will grant inj if party requesting it presents proof that comparative harm they would suffer if harm is significantly greater. 
<!-- (38:30) -->

A PI requires notice of the motion and posting of the undertaking (a bond) but cts have broad discretion in the amount of the bond. 

In the motion papaers for a PI, the P can ask the ct for a TRO, pending a hearing on the prelim injunction if it appears if immediate and irreparable injury will result unless the D is immediately restrained prior to the hearing of the PI.A fed ct TRO is good only until the ct rules on the PI, but not longer than 14 days. The ct can renew the TRO for a second 14 days but it can't renew a 3rd time.

A fed judges order on a TRO granting or denying is not appealable, but by fed statute an order granting or denying a PI is immediately appealable. 

If a judge extends a TRO for longer than 14 days, (for example 30 days) then it is no longer a "temporary" order and becomes a prelim injun and is immediately appealable.

The procedure for a TRO usually reqs notice to the D unless the P can show immediate and irreparable injury will occur before the opposing party can be heard

the ct order for TRO or a PI must contain the cts findings of fact and conclusions of law

Once the ct issues the injunction, it is binding on the D's family members or employees who new of the injunction, even though they were not served with the injunction

The penalty for disobeying an injunction is contempt of court. There are 2 types of contempt:
1. civil
2. criminal

both can result in incarceration, a fine, or both. TO sustain either finding for contempt it is necessary to prove:
1. cts order clearly expressed in unequivocal terms (no ambiguity)
2. the D had knowledge of the order
3. the D knowingly disobeys the order

What makes a contempt proceeding civil rather than criminal is based on whose interest is being vindicated and who will be paid the fine imposed. The purpose of civil contempt is to compensate a P for economic loss because the injunction was violated. If the ct incarcerates the D, usually the D has the keys to the jail in his pocket, simply has to comply w/ ct order and ct will purge the contempt order and release D from jail. (ex: child support arrears)

In contrast, the purpose of criminal contempt is to punish a willful violation of a judicial order to protect the integrity of the ct, and hear the jail sentence is for a definite period of time. (ex: when a D violates an order of protection)

A fine imposed for civil contempt is paid to the P, but a fine imposed for crim contempt is paid to fed govt.

## A - Attachment aka sequestration order

prior to final J, a ct order of attachement order a fed marshall to seize a D's assets, which assets do not have to have any connection w/ P's claim (unlike Quasi In Rem)

Attached asset is then held by marshall as security for payment of the money judgment when it is obtained.

Attachment orders are available whenever a P has demanded a money judgment in whole, in part, or in the alternative. (for example if suing for specific performance, no money dmgs)

Before the ct will grant an attachment order, there must exist "extraordinary circumstances" ex: Door vs State of Conn (1991) 
1. D is a foreign Corp not licensed w/ that state's SoS to do business in that state
2. D is domiciled in that state but P has been unable to serve D after diligent efforts
3. w/ intent to defraud creditors, or to frustrate the P's money judgment, the D has concealed or transferred his assets or is about to do so (constructive fraud) A P's allegation of a D's attempt to defraud must be more than conclusory. in order to establish this extraordinary ground
4. D is a non-domiciled residing outside the state.

<!-- (1:13:00) -->

## R - Receiver
In an equitable action the ct can appoint a receiver to conserve the prop that is the subject matter of the P's suit if their is clear evidence of waste, mismanagement, or dissipation of the subject matter of the lawsuit. Receivers are most frequently used in: 
1. actions to dissolve a corp, partnership, or llc (corporate divorce)
2. mortgage foreclosures of commercial property


## R - Replevin
Replevin seeks to recover a chattel which the P has a superior right. The ct can grant a prejudgment seizure of chattel directing fed marshal to seize. Replevin action seeks to determine who has the superior right to possess the chattel.

If acreditor has a securiity interest (UCC art 9) in a defaulting debtor's goods but the creditor can not exercise "self" to seize the goods without a breach of the peace, then the creditor's remedy is ct order of replevin.

In addition to recovering possession of a chattel, the P may also seek to recover any dmg done to the chattel, as well as to recover it's fair market rental value from the time of the D's wrongful possession.

Alternatively, P can sue for the tort of Conversion, but the measure of dmgs of Conversion is the value of the good the day converted unless that good had a fluctuating value, allowing a P to recover it's higher value at the time of the trial.

# DUE PROCESS ISSUES for PRs

before a ct grants a PR, it must ensure that DP is satisfied by a COP (#4, pg7)
C - Clear and Convincing evi that P is likely to succeed on the merits of her claim and is entitled to the PR requested because of "extraordinary circumstances"
O - Opportunity to be heard by D
P - if LIARRS was obtained ex parte, then an immediate post-seizure hearing is required (5-10 days is "immediate")

# PRE TRIAL DISCOVERY

the pre-trial discovery devices available are **MR AID**. A request for MR AID disc by a party or non-party must allow 30 days to comply.

## Fed Ct scheduling conferences

Within 90 days from commencing a law suit (summons filed) or within 60 days from when a D MAN appeared, the judge or a federal magistrate judge must hold a scheduling conference and issue a scheduling order containing
- ### A: settlement possibilities
- ### B: MR AID discovery schedule, including ESI(Electronically Stored Info)
- ### C: and effort to narrow the issues, claims, and defenses
- ### D: a review of the automatic disclosure req by the parties (see 2 below)

the court's scheduling order usually fixes a "bar date" after which date the parties or claims can not be added, pleading can't be amended, and all discovery must be completed, unless there is otherwise good cause

in fed practice, discovery occurs in **4** stages
1. as soon as is practicable but at least 21 days prior to scheduling conference, the lawyers must "meet and confer" to formulate a proposed discovery plan to discuss w/ a judge at the scheduling conference
2. within 14 days after the scheduling conference, there must be "automatic disclosure" w/o any request of (A) list of any witnesses having info to support a parties claim or defense (B) a list or copy of docs/ESI/any tangible evidence that party possess that may be used to support a parties claim or defense (C) a calculation of damages and how it was computed (D) copies of all liability insurance possibilities that may provide coverage for P's judgement
3. at least 90 days before trial, provide a list of experts retained to testify at the trial, together w/ experts detailed report that must contain an **OOFFER**

### O - experts **Opinion**
### O - **Other** cases in the last 4 years in which expert testified
### F - **Facts** or data used to form experts opinion
### F - **Fee** paid to expert
### E - any **Exhibits** to be used to support experts opinion
### R - experts **Resume**, including any publications authored by expert in the last ten years

4. at least 40 days before trial: a finalized list of exhibits and witness to be offered at trial

If a party supplies MR AID info but later learns prior to trial that earlier response was incomplete or is now materially misleading, there is an ongoing obligation to reveal this to an adversary, and failure to do so may result in sanctions R26(g) **A DRIPS**(CivPro mne p8#5)

FR 26 allows all matter that is not privileged and is relevant to a claim or defense is discoverable prior to trial. Parties can no longer seek discovery on the basis that it could lead to admissible evidence as this standard is too broad.

Before making any motion to fed ct involving pretrial discovery, atty must submit a "good faith" certificate of conference, showing the atty conferred with adversary in good faith to resolve the issues, or to show a good reason why no conversation took place. Cert must indicate the time, place, issues discussed, and resolution. 

## What is not discoverable?
1. evidence protected by a privilege, but priv must be raised otherwise it will be waived (be alert at the deposition, any one else in room waives priv)
2. atty work product onvolving atty subjective mental observations, trial prep, trial startegy, or atty opinon  on the case, which are absolutely priveleged form pretrial discovery
3. material prepared in anticipation of litigation which is qualifiably privileged from discovery, but not if opp party can show:

	1. that material can not be duplicated w/o undue hardship
	2. "substantial need" for the material for the opp party to prepare for trial, and
	3. holding it would result in "undue hardship" to opposing party

When an atty meets w/ a witness, those interview notes are protected as material prepared for litigation, but when a attorney meets with a client, those notes are absolutely privilged under atty/client and atty work product priv. 

Accident reports prepared in the regular course of a business, unlees it was prepared solely for litigation purposes ex: at the request of the liability insurance carrier.

> Example:   
> P hired I, an investigator, who the investigated and gave P a report. This would be protected under work product privilege. At trial, if P calls I to testify, this would waive the privielge and would allow D to demand an inspection of the report to see if it contains anything inconsistent w/ I's testimony

## Protective Orders

A party or non-party witness may make amotion for a protective order denying, limiting, conditioning or regulating the use of MR AID discovery devices to prevent unreasonable **DEEP** (mne Civ Pro p8#2) abuses

### D - **Disadvantage** of one party. ex: disc sought is unR cumulative or duplicitive
### E - prevent **Embarassing** a party or non-party
### E - **Expense** or burden outweigh likely benefit
### P - any other **Prejudice**, such as a request for privileged material

generally the cost of producing ESI, or producing docs for an opponents review, is placed on the producing party, but cts on a DEEP motion have discretion to shift the costs to the party requesting the discovery

In addition to being relevant, demanded discovery must also be proportional to the needs of the case. Proportionality test seeks to discourage discovery overuse. Here the court will consult with a **RAABBI** (mne CivPro p8#4)
### R - party's **Resources**
### A - **Amount** in controversy
### A - relative **Access** to requested info
### B - **Burden** ($) on producing party
### B - **Benefit** to be derived from discovery
### I - **Importance** in resolving the contested issues is case

# Depositions

Fed rules limit party to only 10 depos of one day (7 hours not including lunch or breaks) unless the parties otherwise agree, or the ct allows more. This is refered to as the 10-7 rule

Generally no ct order is req to obtain an EBT (Examination Before Trial), just give at least 30 days notice by serving a demand to party's atty or serving a subpoena to a non-party witness (SWAPS)

A ct order is used/required for the following EBT - RAPPP (mne CivPro p8#3)
### R - **Refusal** to comply to EBT demand
### A - **After** bar date fixed in cts scheduling order
### P - **Prior** to commencing an action
### P - **Prisoners**
### P - **Previously** deposed witness or party

in an attempt to prevent rude and disruptive tactics at depos (EBTs) fed rules have adopted 2 rules:
1. attys are prohibited from advising a witness not to answer a question unless
	1. the question seeks info protected by a privilege
	2. the question violates a prior ct order limiting scope of depo
	3. to quickly suspend the deopsition, to allow a party to make a motion to terminate or limit the depo because of the adversariy's bad faith or unR/annoying/oppresive conduct.  
If a q seeks hearsay evi, or irrelevant evi an atty can not advice a witness not to answer a question because these objections are not waived if not raised at the EBT, can always be raised at trial if the EBT testimony is offered into evidence.
2. any objection to a question must be limited to a succinct, clear statement of the basis for the objection.  
Thus there can be no "speaking" objections by counsel framed to suggest an answer to the witness ("don't guess, answer if you know" "if you can not remember" because this language suggests to the witness to say I don't know/I can't remember)

When seeking an EBT w/ a corp, llc, govt entity, the demanding party must particularly describe the topics that will be explored in the EBT. THe entity then designates an officer/director/or agent to testify as the entity's representative even though she lacks personal knowledge. She will testify after consulting docs and knowledgeable personnel. This fed rule allows entire org to speak through one agent. The ct will impose sanctions if that designated witness is not able to give complete, knowledgeable and binding answers ("I don't know")

```**tested often**```  
Deposition testimony can be used at a trial in 3 ways:
1. if a non-party witness is unavailable at a time of trial then W's EBT testimony is admissible, and the questions&answers can be read into the trial record under the hearsat exception of former testimony provided the following foundation is laid:
	1. notice of the EBT was given to the party against whom it is being offered
	2. the nonparty W is unavailable to testify at the trial (see FR 32: "dead, sick, more than 100 miles from ct")
2. to contradict and impeach either a party's or non party's trial testimony as a "prior inconsistent statement" under FRE (federal rules of evidence) a testifying witnesses prior inconsistent statement made under oath at a formal hearing (a prior trial or EBT) is admissible at a trial to both impeach that witnesses cred and as evidence in chief for the truth of its content because it is not considered hearsay evi. (It is one of the "4 priors")
3. the depo of an available or unavailable opposing party is always admissible at a trial when it is offered by the opposing party. it's an admission of a party opponent and is admissible for any purpose, that is, for the truth of its content or to impeach the opposing party.

## Written interrogatories

Ints are written questions sent by one party's atty to the other. They can not be served on non-party witnesses, only parties.

The rules limit a party to 25 interrogatories, including sub-parts (sub-parts are counted as separate interrogatories)

Ints may be served on the opposing party after the initial "meet and confer" discovery conference that must take place at least 21 days before the court's scheduling conference.

Only the party demanding the interrogatories can use them at the trial as admissions of the opposing party regardless of the opposing party;s unavailibility (irrleveant). A party answering ints can not introduce her answers to her interrogatories since her own self-serving response would be hearsay and does not fit in to any hearsay exception. 

## Request for Production

Unlike EBTs and written interrogatories which seek testimony, requests for production seek to inspect real evidence from a party or non-party. Today most frequently it seeks production of ESI

A party is entitled to demand any of her own prior statements that were made to the opposing party's agents on the subject matter of the lawsuit

A court order is no longer req to demand production from a non-party. Simply serve a subpoena duces tecum (SWAPS) but first notice of the subpoena must be sent to all other attys in lawsuit. 

A medical provider can not respond to a subpoena for a patients medical records unless it is accompanied by an authorization signed by the patient (HIPA)

Docs must be produced in the same way that they were kept in the regular course of biz, or alt, organized and marked to correspond to the categories in the production request.

A nonparty  response to the production demand for biz records (banks, merchants, employers, cc companies, hospital records) can be accompanied by an affidavit signed by someone in the business having personal knowledge of the practices and procedures of the biz records setting forth:
1. the biz records are accurate and complete
2. the 5 elements of the hearsay biz record exception (TRUMP) this easily allows biz records to be introduced at a trial w/o any testimony from someone in that biz but the atty intending to offer the affidavit must advice her adversary of this intent within a "reasonable time" before trial allowing the adversary a R time to object 

```**might be tested**```   
## Confidentiality "quick peak" agreements (vol 1 Civ Pro p112-114)

In an attempt to reduce the huge costs of discovery, especially discovery involving ESI and to allow the producing party to exchange data quickly, w/o waiving a priv, atty can enter confidentiality agreements to limit the harm from accidental and inadvertent disclosure of priv docs in pre-trial discovery. The priv is not waived if "R steps" to prevent disclosure were undertaken. The parties can enter an agreement allowing the disclosing the party to "claw back" privileged material. The disclosing party must promptly notify the other party of any mistaken disclosures. If the parties confidentiality agreement under FRE 502 is incorporated into a ct order, it protects any inadvertently released priv material from being used against the disclosing party in all other state or federal ct actions. 

## Requests for admissions

Other MR AID discovery devices are geared toward discovering evidence but a request for admissions is geared toward easily using known evidence at a trial. It is used to eliminate from the trial the burden of having to prove clearcut, undisputed issues of material fact which would waste time at trial. It can't be used to resolve contested issues, only undisputed issues. 

A demand to admit is deemed admitted unless it is denied within 30 days, but the parties admission is limited to the pending action only

If a party unreasonably refuses to admit, then the costs incurred in proving that fact at trial will be imposed on that party

## Physical or Mental Exams of a Party

These exams req a ct order but cts routinely grant such motions if a party has put her physical or mental condition into issue. EX:
1. P in personal inj action
2. D in K action asserting mental incompetency

# Court Sanctions

```RULE 11 Sanctions just tested on Feb bar, read in book```

Sanctions may be imposed on a party or an attorney who:
1. chronically or willfully refused to comply w/ ct ordered discovery
2. negligently or intentionally failed to preserve critical evidence before it could be inspected by imposing party resulting in prejudice to that party. Under R37, if a party fails to preserve ESI w/ the intent to deny the opposing party of that evidence and it can not be reproduced, then the party does not have to show prejudice and the ct can instruct the jury that it may or must presume that the missing evidence was unfavorable to that party and the ct can even dismiss the P's claim or enter a default J against the D but only if the evidence was destroyed w/ the specific intent to deprive another party of that ESI 
3. failed to make required supplemental disclosure
4. engaged in frivolous conduct

based on 1-4 above, fed cts have broad discretion to impose A DRIPS (mne CivPro p8#5) sanctions

### A - pay for **Atty** fees or other expense
### D - **Dismiss** P's complaint or grant a Default J against A DRIPS D
### R - **Resolve** those issues against the party(ex: P fails to provide a computation of lost profits, then ct could prohibit P from offering any evidence of loss profits, "can't offer evidence? then can't collect") 
### I - jury **Instruction** allowing the jury to draw an adverse inference or presumption. if the discovery involved ESI then this inference can't be used unless the ESI was intentionally destroyed and can't be reproduced
### P - **Preclude** party from offering any evidence on that issue
### S - **Strike** party's pleading or any part thereof

A non-party who fails to disclose may be held in contempt of court

# Appeals

```always comes up in MBE, sometimes MEE```

a condition to taking an appeal is to file a notice of appeal within 30 days from entry of a final order or judgement, or 60 days where the US, a fed officer or agency is a party. The notice of appeal is filed from where the appeal is being taken. The clerk then serves appellant adversary.

14 days after a $ judgement has been entered, the prevailing party can enforce that judgement. 

A bond is required to stave a P's enforcement of a money J. (note that less than 10% of appeals are successful)

when an appellant ct reverses a judgement and orders a new trial, then parties are in same position as if there had been no prior trial and at new trial new evidence can be offered and the rulings in the prior trial ct are disregarded.

under the "final judgemnt rule" most fed ct orders can be appealed only from a final judgement that ends the litigation, thus a R11 santion order is not a final judgement and the sanctioned atty must wait until the final judgement is entered to appeal the sanction order. (NY is the opposite)

## Interlocutory appeals prior to final judgement

In Fed cts there are only 4 types of immediate interlocutory appeals of a fed dist cts order*tested freq*
1. discretionary writ of mandamus where separate lawsuit is commenced in circuit court of appeals naming dist ct judge as D and seeking to compel judge to act according to the law, for example a judges order affecting proper or improper venue or MOP jurisdiction (note that judges don't like this). Mandamus seeks to compell judge to perform her legal duty req by law
2. **collateral order doctrine**. This appeal seeks to prevent harm from a judge's order that does not end the litigation but nevertheless is considered a final order on that issue and thus is immediately appealable because of an LLM (#1p8) L- Last word on that issue, L-final appeal would be too Lat for appellate review, M - order is unrelated to the Merits of the claim and thus a collateral issue ex:
	1. contempt of court order but an order compelling a party's disclosure of privileged docs is not immediately appealable thus counsel should refuse to disclose privileged docs be held in contempt and then immediately appeal the collateral contempt order because it is LLM
	2. The issue of qualified immunity of a state actor in a 42 USC 1983 civil rights claim which always involves 2 issues
		1. was there a C violation?
		2. Did the state actor's conduct violate a clearly established C rule? 
	3. A courts denial of an attorney's motion to withdraw from the fed litigation for the client's non-payment of an atty's fee. here the cts order was the last word on that issue and appellate review of that issue would be too late and this issue does not involve the merits of the claim
	4. an order compelling arbitration of the appellants claim
	5. an order denying party permission to proceed anonymously as john/jane doe


3. where permitted by fed statute
	1. granting or denying or vacating a preliminary injunction for a motion or receiver
	2. granting or denying certification of a class action but it is discretionary with the circuit ct of appeals
	3. certification of an appeal where a dist ct asks a circuit ct to immediately certify an interlocutory issue and circuit ct agrees. the issue appealed must involve a controlling issue of law in the case and there exists disagreements in the courts and termination of the litigation may be advanced by the appellate ct immediately deciding this issue
4. where there are multiple parties or claims (counter claims) and a district ct grants judgement on one claim or against one party (frequently a partial summJ order or a motion to dismiss) and the courts order expressly states there is "no just reason to delay" entry of the judgment against one or more but not all of the parties and claims. This order is deemed a final judgment and is immediately appealable by the aggrieved party.
