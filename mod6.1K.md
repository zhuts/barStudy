mod 6 Contracts

breach of K complaint must "plausibly" (with sufficient facts pleaded) must establish:

	1.the existence of a K
	2.material breach
	3.damages caused by breach
	4.privity of K between P and D

privity is simply a contractual relationship between parties. Generally only parties in privity of K may enforce the terms of a K. 

A valid K is a voluntary agreeement (no duress/undue influence) by competent parties *not infants/incompetents) containing definite terms supported by valid consideration and the K was not induced by any misrepresentations in which the K parties agree to do or not to do a specific thing. It's a promise or set of promisese for which law or equity will provide a remedy if the K is breached.

The basics of a K are TACO:
    T - definite Terms express or implied
    A - Acceptance of the terms
    C - Consideration supporting the K promises
    O - an Offer that invites an acceptance

if a K is not R certain as to it's material terms, then it is not enforceable as a K. ex: when an oral or written K fails to disclose purpose, parties, intent to be bound, or missing a material term. 
ex: in a signed writing O promised N, his 16yo nephew, that O would pay N a handsome reward when N becomes 21 if N does not smoke until that time. N was induced by O's promise not to smoke, although it was contained in a signed writing to satisfy the SoF and the promise to pay was supported by consideration, O's promise is unenforceable as a K because the term "handsome reward" is too uncertain, ambiguous, and indefinite. However, N could asset a quasi-K claim against O
ex: X signed an agreement to purchase Redacre at "fair market value" is sufficiently precise if market value can be determined objectively. For example: where the K defines a methodology for determining a missing term. however, a K to purchase at "fair market value to be agreed upon" or "TBD by a procedure to be later agreed upon" is not enforceable. It is simply an agreement to agree. 
Q: what is an executory K? it is a K awaiting full performance
Problem: In June, T executed a will leaving Blackacre to S, his son. In July, T entered a written K to sell Blackacre to B. In August T died. Since the K was still executory (the deed had not been delivered to B) S's right to Blackacre under T's will is not lost udner the doctrine of ademption of S's specific bequest. Thus, when T died, S takes legal title under the will subject to B's equitable title, and B's right to specifically enfore the K under the doctrine of equitable conversion. 
if the deed had passed to B in July, before T died, then B and T's K was no longer executory, thus S's specific bequest in the will would have adeemed, and S would take nothing because when T died, T had neither legal nor equitable title in Blackacre. 

Ks are divided into 2 general categories
    1. express Ks which must be stated in definite written or oral words
    2. implied Ks which are divided into 2 categories
        a. implied in fact
        b. implied in law
    2:12:00 implied in fact
        arise from one parties conduct that evidences she has impliedly entered into a K (usually to pay $) example: C client sent A atty a proposed K drawn by S to sell C land. S wrote "pls review whether this K is good and whether I should sign it. I will call you when I get back from my vacation." A reviewed it and sent C a bill, but before C returned from his vacation, S revoked the offer to sell. Can A recover from C the client? Answer: yes, under a K implied-in-fact

        Problem: to make extra money, T teenager mowed N neighbors lawn while N was away on vacation. When N returned, N refused to pay T. Q: Can T sue N for quantum maruit ("for as much as he deserves") to recover the fair market value of T's performance ( the price usually and customarily paid for such services)? A: No, it is not "unjust" for N to refuse to pay T if N did not request T's services, and N was unaware the services were being performed. However, an implied-in-fact K would arise if N was at home and watched T cut the grass.  
        Problem: same facts, but assume N was home and T decided as a neighborly gesture to cut N's grass. N watched T labor for 3 hours and then criticized T's job. COuld T then sue N for quantum meriout? A: no, T's intent from the start was gratuitous and the law will not imply an enforceable K from activities that were intended for a gift 

    2:21:00 implied in law AKA quasi K
    a fiction imposed by law to either
        1. prevent one parties unjust enrichment
        2. compensate a performing party who has detrimentally relied on an express but unenforceable K (reliance dmgs)
        A quasi-k implied in law is not a K at all, but rather is an obligation imposed by law to do justice even where it is clear that no enforceable promise existed
        Problem: P K'd to paint O house. Halfway through the paintjob a tornado destroyed O's house. IMpossibility of performance excuses both P and O from further performance, but P can sue in quasi-K on the now unenforcable express K to the extent his services enhanced the value of O's house at the time of it's destruction. Under Restatement 2nd K, when a K is excused for impossiblity the performing party's recoverable dmgs are limited to that amount that P's services increased the value of O's house
    Quasi-Ks arise in only 2 situations:
        1. even though no express agreement between parties, and no conduct by one party to impliedly pay, but inorder to do justice and compensate a performing party, the law will impose a K which arises in only 2 situations:
            a. a doctor stops and renders aid to an **unconscious** victim, doctor may sue in quasi-K for the value of her services even if the victim subsequently died. A quantum  meruit recovery is based on the R value of the medical servies rendered and not based on the value of the benefit conferred
            b. P found X's dmged boat washed up on shore. P repaired it and put into storage. WHen X learned of this and demanded it's return, P has a claim to recover for the expenses of repairing and storing X's property.
        **2.** Where there was an express K between parties but it is unenforceabe because of some K defense, such as illegality, SoF, unconscionability, mistake, or absence of material necessary term to form K BUT where one party has partially performmed or detrimentally relied on that unenforceable promise. COurts usually award only reliance and restitution dmgs, no expectation dmgs (expected profit or losss of bargain dmgs) from an express or unenforceable K.
        In order to recover dmgs on a quasi K claim, a P must eat a PEAR
        P - P's Performance of services in good faith
        E - Expectation of compenstaion
        A - Acceptance of those services performed
        R - Recovery for the R value of the services performed
        K law imposes a Quasi-K under 2 above either to compensate the performing party for reliance dmgs in performing the unenforcable K or awarding restitution dmgs to avoid the unjust enrichment of the other party
        example: P agreed to dye 5k cloth napkins for D at P's plant. Upon completion of the dying process, P agreed to return the goods to D's warehouse. When P was halfway through D's load, a non-negligent fire destroyed everything.
            query: is P liable for the loss of D's goods?
            a: no, this was a bailment K (note this is different from a UCC sales of goods K) for the mutual benefit of both parties because both parties expected a benefit or profit from the K, thus the bailee owed a duty of ordinary care since the fire was not the result of any breach of duty by P (the fire was not P's fault) so P is not liable to D for the loss
            query: is D liable to P?
            a: yes, a quasi-K arises when an express K is partially performed but is then excused by a K defense (impossibility of performance). When bailed goods perish through no fault of the bailee, the bailee is entitled to copmensation to the extent P's services enhanced the value of bailor's property at the time the goods were destroyed.

            problem: for 15 years, P worked part-time for D under an oral promise that D would leave Blackacre to P in his will. When D died P got nothing. SoF prohibits the enforcement of D's express oral promise, but the law will imply a quasi K to avoid D's unjust enrichment and to compensate P for her detrimental reliance on the unenforceable K. P will recover the reasonable value of P's services, but P will not get Blackacre because SoF prohibits enforcement of an express oral K conveying an interest in realty.
            if the ct grants D summJ based on SoF, can P commence a second action against D in quasi-K because of D's unjust enrichment?
            A: no, even though P has a good claim for quasi-K, however under the transactional analysis approach of res judicata(claim preclusion), once a cliam has been brought to final judgment (P's K action was dismissed based on SoF) then all othe rclaims arising out of same tx are subsequently barred even if based on different theories or seeking different remedies

        Quasi-K claim is not available
