A K can expressly prohibit its assignment w/o the written consent of both parties; however, once full performance has been completed by one party, the anti-assignment clause does not prohibit the right of that party to assign that partys right to receive payment. Thus, in a construction K where its assignement is expressly prohibited, once a subcontractor completes performance has to get paid from the general contractor, then the sub can freely assign away its right to recieve that payment. Likewise, heatlh insurance, liability insurance, and fire insurance policies are both expressly and impliedly not-assignable but once the injury/dmg/treatment has occured and their arises a duty by the ins carrier to pay, then the insured's claim for payment can be assigned

**Delegation of Duties**

A delegation of duty is the assignment ot another of the duty to perform under a K. Most duties are freely delegatable except where they call for performance that requires special skills, unique abilities, or the trust and confidence placed by the other K party in having the performance undertaken by the K party.(00:07:15)

an assumption agreement is a promise by an assignee to personally assume liability for the K's performance.

Generally the assignment of a sales of goods K is simultaneously an ADA (Assignment, Delegation of Duty, and Assumpition of Duty to perform) However, an assignment of such a K creates "R grounds for insecurity", allowing the other K party to "demand assurances" (SPARKLE p26) to demand assurances from the assignee, that the assignee can and will perform under the K terms.


# Breach of K

A party breaches a K when:
+ a. she refuses to perform
+ b. she performs but the performance is not in accordance w/ K terms

to plead and prove a K claim, P must claim all 4:
1. the formation of an enforceable TACO K between competent parties. There can be no liability for breach absent proof of a K relationship between parties, that is, privity of K except for claims by 3rd party beneficiarty where privity is not necessary
2. The D's material breach of the K terms
3. performance by the P of any conditions precedent or concurrent conditions(tender) required by the K or proff that the P could've tendered performance but for the D's anticipitory breach
4. damages suffered by the P

A breach of K may occur by (3)
1. a clear and unequivocal repudiation of K prior to performance date ("anticipitory breach")
2. a failure to fully perform
3. a performance that was deficient and was not in accord w/ the K terms

If a breach is immaterial(trivial or minor defects) then this type of minor breach will not totally relieve the other K party to pay for the performance tendered

if the breach is "material" then any duty still owed by the non-breaching party (to pay or to perform) is excused and the contract can be terminated.

Some JNs allow a materially breaching party to assert a seperate claim for unjust enrichment to the extent that the performed K bestowed a benefit to the non-breaching party, but less any dmgs suffered by the non-breaching party

Substantial performance is the opposite of a material breach, thus if a prty has substantially performed then any breach is  immaterial, THe substantial performance doctrine is used most frequently in building construction K, but it may also be applied to other K such as personal service, real estate broker K, or leases of chattel or RP

The substantial performace doctrine is intended to prevent an injustice where a party's breach inadvertently causes minor, nonessential deficiencies that can be easily and inexpensively remedied

the substantial performance doctrine does noty apply to (1-3)
1. sales of goods K where perfect tender rule applies
2. conditions in a K that must be complied with literally
3. a performing party who wilfully breached the K, thus the breach was not innocent or inadvertent, however some cts today now treat a wilfull breach as only one factor as to whether substantial performance was achieved

in most JN, a party's substantial performance is a condition precedent to payment

in a majority of states if there has not been substantial performance, then a breaching party who has only partially performed is not entitled to any compenstaion for her partial performance and in most JN she is denied quasi-K theory

There is no single factor that determines whether the breach is material or immaterial but rest.K2 uses **HAIL** elements
### H - **Hardship** on breaching party if the court declares a material breach
### A - **Amount** of the benefit bestowed on the non-breaching party. The greater the benefit, the less likely the court is to find a material breach
### I - whether it was **Innocent or Inadvertent** or unIntentional breach
### L -  **Likelihood** of full performance being achieved 

The breaching party has the burden of proving substantial performance and the cost to complete the K. A party that has substantially performed can recover the K price less the cost to complete the K (31:30)

Where there has been a substantial performance but where the cost to complete the K is grossly and unfairly out of proportion to the benefit to be achieved and it would constitute economic waste by unding what in good fiath was done, then the measure of dmgs is the difference between the value of the substantial performance and the value of what should've been tendered if there had been full performance of that K

    Q: Is a failure to timely perform by the date in a K a material breach?
    A: not usually, generally a party has a R time to perform. A party does not have to perform by the precise date stated in the K unless the K expressly states "time of the essence"

Time may be of the essence even though the phrase is not sited in the K... it depends on party's intent and circumstances

An unR delay in performing may constitutes a material breach

Usually parties are given a R time to peform

What is "R" time depends on the circumstances. Cts consider (1-3)
1. Hardship on party if not performed by date stated
2. party's intent
3. presence or absence of good faith
<!-- (00:45:25) -->

## Anticipitory Repudiation

Anticipitory breach (AB) arises before pefromance date fixed in K when one party to a bilateral K categorically and unequivicollay anounces an unwillingness or inability to perfrom K. "I will not" or "I can not" perform
> ex:
> 1. buyer states to seller that "goods/services are no longer needed"
> 2. sellers statement that goods can not be timely tendered
> 3. a buyer states that she's found someone else to do the job for a lower price
> 4. seller's statement that goods won't be delivered unless buyer pays higher price

A parties request to renegotiate K price is not AB, nor is a statement that he can't/doubts he can perform the K, or where he requests more time to perform. However, such statements give the other party R grounds for insecurity allowing demands of assurances of performance, and if adequate assurances not given within R time (UCCart2"not more than 30 days", Rest of K does not state a time) then it would constitute a material breach

The AB remedy is not available to a party who has fully performed and where the breaching party's only obligation is to pay for full performance in future installments. The non-breaching party who has fully performed must await each future installment payment date fixed in the K before suing for the breached installment

To avoid this problem an acceleration clause should be inserted in the note expressly allowing an accelleration that all future installements in the event any installment payment is breached

WHen a AB occurs, the non-breaching party can:
1. immediately sue for breach of K
2. wait and urge the breaching party to reconsider but dmgs and the SoL are fixed on the date the non-breaching party first learned of the AB and could've sued for AB

eventhough a non-breaching party notifies the AB party that it will await performance this declaration is not considered an election of remedies thus the non-breaching party may at anytime after the AB immediately commence suit for breach thereby extinguishing the breaching party's power to retract the AB 

What if the AB party has a change of mind and decides to perfrom the K? She can retract the repudiation but not if the non-breaching party has (1-3):
1. commenced lawsuit
2. relied on the repudiation and materially chaged her position by entering a new K for similar goods/realty/performance
3. effectively communicated to breaching party an intent to treat the repudiation as final and indicating the K has terminated

An AB party is not liable for breach if, prior to K date of perf, there arose a supervening impossibility of performance, or some failure by the non-breaching party to be able to tender her performance required in the K

An AB party is excused from liability if the non-breaching party can not prove that it could've tended performance on the K date
> EX:  
> in Feb D agreed to paint O's house on June 1. In March D repudiated the K. In April O's house burns down. This impossibility of performance would discharge D's AB, relieving D from having to pay dmgs because on June 1st date for tender he can not show that he would've been RAW (Ready, Able, Willing to tender Performance)  

>  R promise to E for 9 months beginning on July 1. On May 1 R repudiates K, but on June 1 (1)E dies or (2) E gets sick and is unable to work for a year. This would excuse R from liability because E can not prove he is RAW

# Breach of K Defenses

When sued for breach of K, a D should consider raising one or more of the following 14 defenses (mne K #10,p2) **III FUUMED & I SSIP** (1:09)

## I - Infancy, mental Incapacity, or Intoxication of K party
there can be no meeting of the minds if one of the minds is incompetent. K involving incomptent parties are voidable at the incompetent's option.

The 3  I may be used defensively when the incompetent is sued, or affirmatively by the incompetent commencing an equitable action to rescind the K and seek restitution
___
### Infancy
___
if an adult signs as a surety for an infants K to guarantee payment then the surety can not raise the infancy defense because it can only be raised by the infant

after reaching majority an infant may ratify the voidable K by manifesting an intent by words,acts or inactivity) which a R person would obj construe as an assent by the former infant to be bound by the K.
> ex  
> after reaching 18, making installment payments on K, or accepting contractual benefits

this ratification does not need to be supported by any new consideration

K law treats infants differently depending on whether the infant is P or D in lawsuit

where goods are sold to an infant on **credit** and the infant braches the K by not making the agreed installment payments, then when a creditor sues the infant as a D that creditor has only a limited right for restitution to the extent the infant still possess fruits from that K

where the infant paid cash and received the goods but then seeks to rescind the fully performed K as a P, then the infant must make full restitution to the extent of any benefits received from the voidable K

> ex  
> rental value of chattel or depreciation caused by infant's use

both infants and their parents are liable for "necessaries" burnished to the infant based on quasi K
___
### mental Incompetentcy

when rescinding a K, a mental incompetent must make FULL restitution to the extent of any benefit received from the voidable K. Some JN do not require an MI to restore the status quo if the K party acted unfairly with knowledge of the existing MI.

If a **judicially-declaed** incompetent enters a K, that K is void. For non-adjudicated MI, K is voidable at the MI's option. 

To succesfully assert MI requires proof of either:
1. the incompetent did not understand the nature and consequences of entering the K
2. executing a K was an uncontrolled reaction to mental illness AND the other party had reason to know of this condition

___
### Intoxication

to rescind a K for intox(drugs or alcohol) the K party must've been so intoxed that they did not understand the nature and consequences of entering the K and the other party had reason to know of this condition

___
## F - Fraud, deceit or negligent misrepresentation

a party can sue for a false material representation (a lie) made (a-c)
+ a. fraudulently that D knew was false which gives rise to a K claim for fraud or tort claim for deceit
+ b. negligentlym which gives rise to a K or tort claim
+ c. innocently, which allows only rescission of the K and restitution

Fraud or deceit claims arise where a party gains an advantage by lying about a material fact and that lie was justifiably relied upon by the other K party

P may assert the K doctrine of fraud to rescind a K or more sue for the tort of "deceit" to recover dmgs. these 2 claims have the same **SIIR M** elements (mne K p3#12) which must be established by clear and convincing evidence. under FR 9b a party's pleading must state w/ particularity the SIIR M elements and the circumstances constituting the fraud. the complaint must 
1. specify the statement that the P contends were fraudulent
2. identify the speaker
3. assert when and where the statements were made
4. explain how the statements were fraudulents
5. explain how they were relied upon by the P
6. dmgs suffered by the P
### S - Scienter (knowledge)
by the D knowingly lying or conceiling a material fact
### I - Intent
the lie must be made Intentionally or recklessly with the Intent to induce the P to enter the K. Statements are made recklessly when there is no basis to make the representation. Fraud includes the presence of knowledge where there is none (compared to recklessly). 
### I - Injury
### R - Reliance by the party claiming to be fraudulently induced
generally a P can't claim reliance on a misrepresentatino that was made to a 3rd party unless it was intended to be communicated to the P
### M - missrepresentation or omission of a Materuial fact inducing P into the K
A fraud claim does not arise from simple opinions or predictions as to what will occur in the future

if a direct question involving a material fact is asked by the other K party, then K law imposes a duty for an honest response. By ignoring the question knowing that a true answer would prevent the other party from entering the K is a material missrepresentation

> ex.  
> "has your car ever been in an accident?" "my mechanic has inspected and feels that it is a fine car"

likewise, active concealment of realty or chattel may constitute fraud

CL, rest of K, and UCC all measure dmgs for tort of deceit on expectation dmgs (loss of bargain), which = difference between:
+ what the P was fraudulently promised, vs,
+ what the P actually received

the guiding principle of K dmgs is to place the non-breaching party as good of a position as performance would've under the terms of the K. A defrauded buyer gets the benefit of the bargain and is not limited merely to recovering out-of-pocket expenses from a fraudluent seller of goods

```
problem: B purchased Blackacre from S for $100k for the purpose of selling bottled water. S presented forged docs that the water on Blackacre was pure and unlimited in quantity and had govt approval. If S representation had been true, Blackacre was in fact worth $175k, but Blackacre was in fact worth only $75k.

here B can recover $100k, which is the difference between what B received ($75k worth of land) and what B would've received if S's representation was true.

if S's repreesentation was negligent, not fraudulently, then B's dmgs limited to out-of-pocket loss ($25k)
```

Constructive fraud under the uniform fraudulent transfer act arises when a debtor transfers assets for inadequate consideration either before or after a creditor's claim arose against the debtor

1. if the gratuitous transfer was made after the creditor's claim arose, then fraudulent intent is presumed and the creditor only has to prove the debtor did not receive fair consideration for the transfer and the debtor was insolvent or became insolvnet because of the transfer
2. the gratutious transfer preceded the creditors claim and was made to hinder or delay creditor and the debtor did not receive full consideration for the transfer and the debtor's remaining assets were unR small in relation to the debts intended to incur in the near future

due to the difficulty of proving actual fraudulent intent to hinder or delay creditors, there are certain badges of fraud that are so commonly associated with a fraudlent transfer that their presence gives rise to an inference of an attempt to defraud (mne K p3#13a) **SHIRTS**

### S - transfer was Secretly done
### H - transfer was Hastily done
### I - Inadequate consideration
### R - close Relationship between parties
### T - whether the Trasferor continued to control transfered property
### S - Scientor (knowledge) of the creditors claim or future claim and the inability to pay it after the transfer

## Negligent Misrepresentations (negligent fraud)
the major diff between tort of deceit and tort of neg missrepresentation is an absence of Scientor for a negligent missrepresentation

a recovery for neg missrepreesentation is limited to P's out-of-pocket losses, not expectation lost profit dmgs

comparative neg is a defense to a neg missrep claim

to assert neg mis there must exist a special relationship between P and D that created a duty for the D to give P correct info

a claim for neg misrep where a bizperson (surveyor, lawyer, fin planner, accountant) breaches a duty owed to the client to provide the client w/ accurate info. This arises where the biz person failed to:
1. exercise R care to ascertain the true facts, or
2. possess or apply the skill and competence of a R person in the D's trade or profession

when a biz or professional person neg makes false statements that they honestly believed were true then that biz or professional is liable for the economic loss suffered because of the P's justifiable reliance on the info.

In most states only a limited class of persons can sue for this tort. Reqs either privity of K between P and D (attorney and client) or a relationship that comes close to privity of K where the P was actually known to the D (they communicated) and the P was the "target" of the D's neg misrep.

> ex  
> 1. a lawyer neg draws up a will and it's not admitted to probate and the beneficiaries of that will suffer a financial loss
> 2. an accountant neg prepares a P&L statement for a corp. sale
> 3. an engineer neg prescribes an energy plan for co-op

some states (minority view) do not req this privity-type relationship in order to assert the neg misrep 

```
B hired A who neg appraised painting as an original, but it was an excellent forgery. B purcahsed the painitng for $250k and had K to sell it to X for $450k when forgery was discovered. The forgery was worth only $100k.

Q: how much can B recover from A for A's neg misrep?
A: $150k, here A and B were in privity but since the misrep was neg B can only recover for out-of-pocket losses, and not the addtl $200k lost profit that B would've made in the resale
```
## innocent misrepresentations
it is much easier to prove this claim because P does not have to prove D's farud or even neg in making the fraud statement, however the eclusive remedy for an innocent misrep is rescission of the K and restitution dmgs
___
## U - Unconscionability
___
an unconscionable K is such a bad bargain that a R person would not agree to it and a fair person would not offer it. Unconscionability allow a cts equity power to intervene and prevent an injustice. It gives cts broad discretion to either void the entire uncon K or just 'blue pencil'(delete) a particular uncon provision

Unconscionability has 2 elements requiring proof of both uncon tactics and uncon terms
1. pre-K procedural uncon is where cts look at the circumstances surrounding the K's execution, sucha as
    1. high pressure sales tactics
    2. absence of any meaningful choice by one party where the K was tendered on a "take it or leave it" basis ("hurry up and sign")
    3. not allowing a party to consult with an attorney
    4. not allowing any changes to the printed form K
    5. unequal bargaining positions of the parties, such as a parties lack of sophisticated biz experience, or lack of education
2. substantive uncon involving very unfair terms in the K such as a ridiculously unfair price

a presumption against uncon arises where sophsiticated biz people make K in a commercial setting
<!-- 2:28:10 -->
uncon is determined at the time of the K and whether it was uncon at that time

uncon applies to UCC sales of goods K, personal service K, real prop K, and leases of chattel or real prop

___
## U - Undue Influence
___
this seeks to excuse party from a K because it was not entered into voluntarily. unlike the defense of duress which speaks of coercion, undue influence speaks of unfair pursuasion by the misuse of a position of trust, confidence, or control by exercising a dominate psycho advantage to obtain an unjust enrichment at the expense of another susceptible and weaker party. It reqs
1. a special relationship such as close family relationship, atty-client, clergy-penitent, or physician-patient
2. unfair persuasion of the weaker by the stronger by manipulating the weaker party into signing the K which, if left alone, she would not have signed

___
## M - Mistake
___
Mistake is simply a party's belief that is not in accord with the facts. it is an incorrect assumption by one party (unilateral mistake) or by both (mutual mistake).

Equity will rescind a K and grant the P restitution for:
1. mutual mistake
2. unilateral mistake by one party if it was knwon to the other party, that is, an offeree can not accept an offer if she knows or R should know that offeror is laboring under a unilateral mistake, It amounts to fraud by not disclosing the error to that party.

a unilateral mistake has to value (the price to be paid) or a mistake as to the amount of material or labor necessary to perform K is simply an error in biz judgment and is not grounds to set aside a K

a unilateral mistake in calculating figures may give the mistaken party a remedy of equity of rescission. See COPS (mne p3#13)
### C _ mistake was **Communicated** to other party before party changed position on reliance of the mistaked figures
### O - mistake involved **Ordinary** Neg
### P - **Prompt** notice of mistake given
### S - mistake will impose **Substantial** hardship if not corrected by the K

COPS is frequently used in sales of goods K and in construction K to prevent unjust enrichment of the other party

Mutual mistake is a substantial mistake existing at the time K was entered which was shared by both parties regarding a material fact in the K that was caused by a latent ambiguity. The law will not enforce such a K because there never was a meeting of the minds and neither party should profit from a mistake jointly received and acted upon.

> ex.  
> "I agree to buy your oldest car for $4k." (ambiguity in what the oldest car is)

mutual mistake is not a substantial change in value after the K was entered into

```
B agreed to buy from S Pinkacre consisting of 70 acres for $700k. If after K was signed, B's survey shows Pinkacre was only 50 acres. B's remedy is to seek rescission of the K based on parties mutual mistake

if however the K provided for a "price per acre" sale price for a total purcahse price of $700k, then because the sale price was not "ingrossed" but was based on a per-acre price then B has the option of rescinding K based on mutual mistake or seeking specific performance of the K with a reduction of the purchase price for the missing 20 acres.


F found a small pretty stone and sold it B for $100 thinking it might be topaz. Both F and B expressed ignorance as to the stones quality and value and B was truly surprised when a jeweler told B it was a $10k yellow diamond.

Is this a basis to rescind? No, there was no mutual mistake as towhich stone was sold and no mistake as to its nature or uncertain value. Risks as to current or future value are assumed by both K parties. F's mistake was simply a mistkae as to value. There existed a conscious uncertainty as to its value and both parties took a risk that it might be worth more or less then the K price.

Could F seek to rescind K on the basis of uncon? No, because at the time the K was executed the substantive and procedural elements of the K (terms and tactics) were not unconscionable. Risks as to present or future value, or of future events are usually assumed by the K parties where there was no mistake as to what the parties intended, but rather one party's mistake concerning the quality or value of the item sold, then this typoe of mistake is not a basis to rescind a K
