(still in defences)
(p40q18)(0:01:00)

**failing to read a K**

    in the absence of fraud or unconscionability a party who signs a K is conclusively presumed to know its content and agrees to be bound by its terms. if the party could read then not reading the K is inexcusable, if he could not read (illiterate) then failing to have it read is equally inexcusable

**8.Equitable Defenses (A-D)**

    **A. K Reformation =**

        where there is no mistake as to what the parties intended or agreed upon, but rather the mistake was made in reducing the oral agreement to a writing by omitting an agreed upon term or inserting an incorrect term then the remedy is reformation to correct that writing

        reformation does not seek to terminate the party's relationship but to continue it in a modified form. Parole Evidence (mneumonic 19) is admissible to show the mistake

        reformation allows the court to rewrite the K and to conform it to party's intent. 

    **B. Laches**
    
        the laches defense is available only in equitable actions where a plaintiff has unreasonably and inexcusably delayed in seeking equitable relief but has nevertheless timely commenced the equitable claim within the SoL time period but under the circumstances it would be unfair to grant equitable relief. Here a D must show (1 &2)
            (1) unR by P in seeking equitable reflief
            (2) changed circumstances that would result in substantial prejudice to the defendant if equitable relief was granted by the court

    C. The relative hardship test where courts balance the equities of the 2 parties (see mneumonic PILE and see Specific Performance)**

    D. Unclean Hands doctrine

        based on a premise that he who seeks equity must enter the court with "clean hands". THis doctrine prohibits equitable relief to a party who is guilty of an immoral/illegal/unconscionable scheme. It is not invoked for the benefit of a D who asserts this D but rather to protect the integrity of the court. Equity will not assist a party who has engaged in unlawful or inequitable conduct. This doctrine is discretionary with the court and it may decline to invoke it against a party who, although at fault, may be less culpable then the other more culpable K party (see defense of illegality, constructive trust)

**Duress**

    WHen a party signs a K out of fear induced by a wrongful threat or battery that overcame that party's freewill compelling her to involuntarily accept the terms of the agreement then the duress defense arises. It is a wrongful threat of physical violence (tort of battery, false arrest/imprisonment,blackmail, or a threat to destroy)

    requires 2 elements
        1. coercion
        2. no reasonable alternative but to agree to K or its modification

    a coerced transaction may be rattified by the coerced party accepting that K's benefits thereby ratifying the K's validity by not promptly moving to have court rescind coerced K

    where one K party threatens to wrongfully withhold goods or services and demands a higher price then the price stated in the K, this constitutes economic duress which can be succesfuly asserted but only where "cover" aka substitute performance (CIDS WAR #30p6) was not readily available in the market place

    If cover was available then the proper remedy is to go into market, purchase substitute and then sue the breaching seller for the difference in the higher cost

    where a corporate party breaches a K and the bank threatens to start a lawsuit for breach of K unless a corporate official signs the breached K as a guarantor on the debt (surety) or the corporate official agrees to modiy the breach K in terms beneficial to the bank then this is a legitimate form of coercion. A threat to do that a party has the legal right to do does not constitute duress, thus the threat to exercise a legal right is not duress.
    (p41#19)

**Impossibility of Performance (aka defense of Excuse)**

    if it becomes objectively impossible to perform a K, because of changed circumstances then a parties non-performance does not constitute a breach of K because performance is excused by its impossibility allowing either party to terminate K w/o liability

    impossibility must arise from unanticipated and unforeseen event that could not have been guarded against in the K and is narrowly applied by US courts because the purpose of a K is to allocate the risks that my affect performance thus a performance should be excused only in limited circumstances

    EX: a developer enters a K to buy land, she intended to subdivide the land and sell individual parcels. AFter the K but before the deed was delivered, zoning law was changed prohibiting the subdivision. Since a change in zoning was clearly a foreseeable event, developer can not rescind the K based on impossibility.

    TO establish the excuse defense, show (a-d)
        a. something unexpected or unforeseen occurred after executing the K. if it occurred prior to entering the K and it was unknown to either party then the defense would be mutual mistake
        b. risk of that event was not covered in the K or by custom in the trade(0:46:40)
        c. it's non-occurence was a basic assumption on which the K was made
        d. performance was made impossible by the intervening event or under UCC or RestK it became economically imporacticable to perform the K

    The defense of excuse is divided into 3 categories.
        1. Impossibility where the subject matter of the K or the means of performance make a party's performance impossible
            ex: death, serious illness, disibility of performing party in a personal service K, or uncovering hazardous waste buried at a construciton site rendering the contractors perforance impossible

            in a personal services K, a party's serious illness or danger to health will excuse either party from the K
        2. Frustration of purpose

            to invoke this doctrine, the frustrated purpose must've been the complete basis of the party's bargain and both parties understood without it the transaction makes little sense

            eventhough performance is still possible, its purpose has now evaporated and performance is meaningless to one party. this doctrine is not frequently followed in the US. it applies when a change in circumstances makes one parties performance virtually worthless to other party, thereby frustrating the purpose for making the K

            if the intervening event was foreseeable by the parties and its occurence could've been asserted in the parties K, then generally this defense can not be asserted

        3. Commercial Impracticability(1:00:00)

            Arises when performance is possible but an unforeseen change in market prices the seller's increase cost of goods or performance has become economically unrealistic such as a price increase of double or triple the original K price

            under UCC art II unforeseen severe shortages of supplies caused by war, crop failure, trump's embargos, government restrictions, or a shutdown of major source of supply resulting in SEVERE cost increases falls within the realm of commercial impracticability. Most courts do not follow this commentary in the UCC because courts find that such events are foreseeable and radical change in price is the very thing a fixed price K is designed to protect against. A more relieable remedy for the parties is to execute a detailed K to protect against such events

    The theory of impossibility frequently involves (4D)
        1. Death of a performing party
        2. Danger to life or health
        3. Destruction of the subject matter of the K
        4. Delays causing performance tp become impossible or commercially impracticable (ex: mudslide or flood closing the road to a building site for months, or performing party is currently deployed)

    In a UCC sale of goods K, floods, major storms, or civil riots can excuse a seller's late delivery of goods, preventing a buyer from invoking perfect tender rule (1:09:00)

    **TESTED OFTEN**
        In a construciton K for a new structure, risk of loss is on the builder if the structure is destroyed before its title is turned over to the buyer

        In a K to alter or repair an EXISTING STRUCTURE, then its destruction will excuse performance (impossibility of performance) but RoL (risk of loss) is on the building owner. If the contractor has partially performed prior to destruction, then the contractor has a restitution claim in quasi-K but only to the extent her services enhaned the value of the structure prior to destruction

**Statute of Frauds**

    purpose of SoF is to avoid fraudulent claims and purjic testimony on certain types of K. in order for such K to be enforceable, they must be in writing and signed "by the party to be charged" with its breach (signed by the D) the signed writing does not have to take any particular form. it does not have to be prepared to satisfy the SoF, and it can even be executed months after the oral K was entered, and the signed writing could even be addressed to a 3rd party

    it can be on
        1. a check
        2. a placemat or napkin
        3. signed minutes from a bourd of directors meeting approving the K
        4. an email containing the senders electronic signature which under the uniform electronic transaction act adopted in 47 states satisfies the SoF signature requirement (01:17:39)
        5. several related docs or emails which when pieced together constitute a signed enforceable K

        a signed letter can simultaneously acknowledge and repudiate a prior K which satisfies the SoF

        Problem: B wrote to S "I have found a better house then your Blackacre and therefore do not wish to buy it for $200k, even though we orally agreed to do so"

        Problem: S mailed a signed offer to sell Blackacre to B for $200k. B phones S and says "I accept your offer". 2 weeks later B chages her mind.
            Q: can S sue B for money dmgs or specific performance?
            A: No, the K involves an interest in Realty and there exists no writing signed by the party (B) to be charged with breach
            Q: Assume it is S, not B that changed mind. Can B sue S for $ dmgs or specific performance?
            A: Yes, because written offer is signed by the party to be charged (S) with breach

        If a K satisfies the SoF (example a signed real property K) the parties are free to orally cancel it unless the K expressly prohibits oral cancellation and requires a signed writing

        The following K must be in writing signed by the party to be charged (pg3#14) MRS SLY:
            M - Marriage K

                where consideration supporting a promise to pay money or to transefer property is the other party's promise to get married, then the promise to pay must be in a signed writing and part-performance (the marriage) does not take the K outside of the SoF

            R - Real Property K

                An oral agreement to convey an interest in real property(except for a lease term < one year>) is unenforceable because of the SoF
            
            S - Surety K
                1.
                2. S and Creditor
                3. S and Debtor
                (1:33:00)
                The surety's promise to the creditor must be in writing signed by the surety. A signed writing is not required on the K between the surety and the debtor.

                Where F father asks M merchant to supply goods or services to decorate D daughter's apartment, this is not a surety K, but rather a K between F and M with D as intended TPB (third party beneficiary) M's only recourse is against F, not D

                under the main purpose rule, where a surety's intent (main purpose) is really to benefit the surety, then no signed writing is required for the creditor to enforce the oral promise

            S - Sale of Goods K for >$500 
                (see mod9 mneumonic 26)
            
            L - Leases (realty) longer than one year
                must be signed by the party to be charged or agent whose authority to sign is in a signed writing
            
            Y - one Year

                A bilateral K which by its express terms has absolutely no possibilty of full performance within one year from its execution must be placed in a signed writing. EX: 2 year employment K with option to terminate on 30 days notice, a signed writing is nevertheless required because complete performance is not capable within 1 year

                the determination whether an oral K can be performed within a year from its making is not done by looking back at how long it took to perform the K, instead it requires an analysis of what was possible by looking forward from the date the K was made (01:49:30)

                B builder orally agreed with O (1) to construct a house and (2) to give O a one year warranty to run from the completion of the home
                    - agreement (1) does not have to be in a signed writing since house is capable of being completed within a year
                    - (2) is not enforcable because by its express terms, the warranty is not capable of complete performance within a year 

                A lifetime employment K does not fall within the one year SoF since, by its terms, it is capable of complete performance within a year since by its terms it is implied could die within a year

            ordinarily part-performance of a MRS SLY oral K does not excuse the SoF requirement, however a party's part performance may result in either (a-f)

                (a) a quasi K claim to compensate the performing party either to prevent unjust enrichment or to reimburse the performing party because of her detrimental reliance on the unenforceable oral K (PEAR q1&2 p23-24)

<!-- second half of mod8 -->
<!-- illegality -->
<!-- PER (essay in Feb) -->

                (b) a claim for specific performance of an oral real property K but the part-performance must be more then the buyer just taking possesion of the realty, it requires conduct that unequivicolly refers to alleged oral agreement to sell realty. The part-performance involved must convincingly point to existence of agreement to transfer property to buyer (PIP see mod12RP) 

                (c) enforcement of an oral K for the sale of goods (no 26 p5)

                (d) a parties full performance is considered reliable evidence of K removing one year SoF defense to such an oral K

                ex: oral bilateral K for E to work for R for 3 years at which time R promised E $100k bonus (not capable of full performance within one year!) HOwever, E's full performance extinguishes R's one year SoF defense

                (e) estoppel doctrine

                if an oral MRS SLY K is not put into signed writing, consider estoppel doctrine but only where the injury to the party that has relied on oral promise is so great that enforcing the SoF would be "unconscionable"

                estoppel is also used where the promise detrimentally relied upon lacked consderation. courts rarely invoke th eestoppel doctrine. 

                eventhough not supported by consideration, a promise to make a charitable gift is enforceable based on estoppel, which displaces the need for consideration
                
                problem: P purchased an antique desk for $10k. P asked S her sister to store it in S's basement and P asked S to get insurance on the desk because P was leaving the country the next day. S agreed to do so but she forgot, a month later a non-negligent fire destroyed the desk.
                    Q: May P recover the loss from S?
                    A: yes, generally a bailee is under no duty to insure bailed goods but if there is an agreement to insure goods, then even if the bailee undertakes to act gratutiously (no consideration) the law imposes duty on bailee to obtain insurance. P's best argument is promissory estoppel, estopping S from asserting there was no consideration to support promise

                problem: at T tenant's oral request, L landlord hastily made $500k of leasehold alterations and improvements for T's oral 4-year lease. When alterations were completed T refused to move in and L sues T asserting (1) breach of express oral 4-year lease and (2) cause of action for quasi K to recover value of work performed in reliance on T's express but unenforceable oral promise

                    - the parties oral agreement is unenforceable because under the SoF a lease period over a year must be in writing and signed by the party to be charged (T) 
                    - the estoppel doctrine L could recover the fair market value of the improvments based on L's detrimental reliance on T's oral promise (that is unenforceable) even though there was no actual benefit (unjust enrichment) to T

                (f) constructive trust doctrine

                    which frequently is invoked as an exception to the SoF. A CT is imposed by equity based on an oral promise coupled with an abuse of a confidential relationship in which property or $ was transfered based on an oral promise which was then breached and the transferee was unjustly enriched 

                    whenever property has been acquired under circumstances that the holder of that property or $should not in good consciounce retain it then equity converts that person into a trustee

                    CT requently arise from intrafamily oral will property agreements in which a family member agrees to later reconvey all or part of the real property involved to the other

                    there are 4 TCUP elements for a CT (#16p3)

                        T- Transfer of property/$ in reliance of an express or implied promise

                        C - Existence of a confidential or fiduciary relationship that arises from trust and requires one person to act for the others benefit

                        U - Unjst enrichment to the transferee or some third person

                        P - Promise, express or implied, to hold property for P's benefit and promise is breached

                    party has burden of provign the TCUP by "clear and convincing" evidence

                    A defense to a CT claim is the equitable defense of "unclean hands" based on public policy to protect integrity of court
                    (02:28:20)
                        ex: spouse 1 was getting divorced and conveyed his RP to G his gf to avoid having to pay half of the value of the property to spouse 2. ALthough there exist the TCUP elements for a constructive trust, equity would not assist spouse 1 in recovering the property from G if G refused to reconvey it after the divorce.

                        also, spouse 1 would be judicially estopped from claiming ownership of the realty because in his prior divorce action he stated under oath that he did not own the asset, thus he would be estopped in the second proceeding (TCUP action) from adopting a contrary judicial position inconsistent from his earlier judicial position in the divorce action
                    
**Statue of Limitations**

**Illegality**

    A K is illegal if either its formation or its performance is criminal, tortious, or otherwise oppossed by public policy. With illegal K, disputes involving coconspirators who are in peri delicto (equal or mutual fault) cts will refuse to assist these wrong-doers in enforcing their K. the peri delicto defense and the unclean hands defense are frequently used interchangeably 

    This is similar to tort law "outlaw doctrine" which states that one who has been tortiously injured by another while engaging in a serious criminal act can not sue to recover for resulting personal injuries.

    If after entering a legal executory K its performance becomes illegal by a change in law, then it is the impossiblity of performance defense that excuses a party's performance.

    If a K contains both lawful and unlawful objectives but the illegal part can be severed, then if one party has performed and that performance was not illegal then payment for that performance can be enforced in a claim for restitution or quasi K

    where an illegal K violates a K but its conduct is not inherently dangerous or illegal (not a CL felony) then cts will not automatically deny one party of recovery but will instead apply Rest 2nd K and consider THUG (#17p4). For example, failing to comply with a revenue raising statute such as a moving company failing to obtain a license.
        T - Type of illegality involved and the extent public is harmed (child pornography vs income tax avoidance)
        H - Harm that forfeiture would cause one of the party of the illegal K, especially with part-performance 
        U - Unjust enrichment to the party asserting the illegality defense
        G - relative Guilt of each party (peri delicto doctrine)

##Parol Evidence Rule aka Extrinsic Evidence Rule

**NOTE: tested on Feb essays**

SoF speaks of an agreement where there is no required writing, but PER indicates the existence of a writing and whether it can be supplemented with prior parole evidence of the party's pre-K negotiations

PER is not a rule of evidence, it is a rule of K law to assist cts interpreting written K. If the K terms are clear and unambiguous and the written K contains all required terms and it was itnended by parties as final and complete expression of agreemnent, then it is an INTEGRATED (completed) agreemnet and PER prohibits one party from contradicting or supplementing the writing with terms that were allegedly agreed upon prior to or during the K execution

A simple merchant memorandum (mneumonic 26 p5 SWA*M*P) sent to confirm an oral sales of goods K is not an "integrated" K because parties generally do not intend a simple memorandum to contain all of the K terms

A partially integrated K which is final and binding but incomplete because it did not contain the date for complete performance may be supplemented with prior parole evidence but only with consistent additional terms

Q: in a written B bar agreed to buy cases of beer from S at $4 per case. Thereafter B could not try to introduce evidence that S orally agreed that if B bought fore then 100 cases per week S would reduce the price by 10%. This evidence would violate the PER because regardless as whether the K is partially integrated, the price term is essential part of K and admitting such evidence would contradict the existing price

where a K term is ambiguous or the K is incomplete (not "integrated") then prior CONSISTENT TERMS parol evidence is admissible as long as it does not contradict an existing K term

to discuss the meaning of the words used "usage in the trade" evidence can be introduced to show that ordinary words have acquired a trade meaning

03:04:00
the term "36 inch steel" can be shown to have a trade meaning so that delivery of 37" steel was not a breach of K

under UCC art 1, ecidence of usage of trade offered in court by one party is not admissible unless that party gave adversary R pre-trial notice, sufficient to prevent unfair surprise of the other party

### Merger Clauses

if the party's K contains a merger clause, it requires the court's full application of the PER barring the introduction of extrinsic evidence to either alter or contradict the K. A merger clause establishes the party's intent that their agreement was completely integrated and a merger clause prevents one party from later attempting to alter the K with earlier terms that were not set forth in that K. "This writing our entire agreement" (UBE essay Feb 2018)

under the UCC & Rst K, where a K involves repeated occasions for performance coupled with repreated opportunites for objections, then "any course of performance" accepted w/o objection shall be relevant and admissible in determining the meaning of the agreement. The party's themselves know best what they meant by the words in the K and their actions during the agreement are the best indication of what the meaning was. 

even if the course of performance is inconsistent w/ an express term in the K , this may nevertheless be introduced to show that the parties has manifested an intent to modify or waive a K term which PER does not prohibit

once a K is formed the parties may modify it by agreement or by a course of performance or by conduct amounting to a waiver or modification of the K. Neither a merger clause nor PER prohibits proof of the parties SUBSEQUENT modifications of a written K. PER applies only to contemporaneous or prior oral/written negotiations in the K's formation but itdoes not apply to subsequent negotiations to modify the terms of an existing K. (UBE essay Feb 2018)

Where a K expressly precludes its oral mod or recission then generally any modification or recission must be contained in a signed writing. Such a clause precludes a claim for oral modification of the writing, however in a sales of goods K to bind a NON-MERCHANT to such a clause (usually a customer) it must be seperately signed or initialled by the non-merchant in the original K

The PER does not prohibit evidence introduced at trial to prove (mneumonic#19p4) OF MICEE

O - the contract itself does not become effective unless there is an **Oral** condition precendent, provided that oral condition did not contradict express terms of the K

here such evidence is not being offered to alter a K term but to show that the K never became legally effective because the condition precedent failed

F - PER can not be invoked to prevent evidence of FRAUD (SIR M #12p3) in the inducement of the K

M - MUTUAL MISTAKE or a claim for reformation of the K

I - evidence to show the K is ILLEGAL

C - to show a failure of CONSIDERATION, thus even though the K terms stated the buyers consideration was paid, parol evidence is admissible to show if the money was never exchanged

E - to EXPLAIN and ambigous term 

E - to show no ENFORCEABLE agreement was intended by the parties

ex: to contradict a deed for real property or an installemnt sale of real property, to show it was intended as an equitable mortgage (in class q22p44)

# K remedy of dmgs

A P suing for breach of K may seek equitable or legal remedies

the legal remedy of dmgs seeks to compensate a P for any profits lost as well as any losses sustained by the D's breach. the dmgs remedy is intended to put P in position that is economically equivalent to the position she would've been in w/o breach

in fed cts dmgs must be pleaded w/ R certainty, 14 days after the cts initial scheduling conference the P must serve on the D a doc containing all dmgs and how they were calculated

Generally dmgs are measured at the time of the breach for lost value/profit to the non-breaching party, based on what the party should've received under the K terms and the value of what was in fact received + incidental dmgs and FORESEEABLE consequential dmgs - any expenses the non-breaching party would've incurred to fully perform K but did not incur because of breach (p14#5)
(3:31:43)

Parties are free to alter the rules for dmgs and to allocate them differently, for example inserting an exculpatory dmgs clause or a liquidated dmgs clause

K law does not allow a dmg recovery for CAPS (#20p4)

C - CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES that were not within CONTEMPLATION of parties because not R apparent or foreseeable as a probable result of one party's breach. consequential damages usually refer to loss economic oportunites (lost profits) caused by the breach(hadley v. jacksondale)

unlike in tort law where D takes P as he finds her, consequential (lost profit) dmgs must've been within contemplation of parties at the time K was entered into (#2p13)

A - damages that could've been AVOIDED, thus there is a duty by the non-breaching party to mitigate dmgs whenever possible. ANy expenses occurred when attmping to mitigate are recoverable

a P who stubbornly continues to perform after other party has repudiated K can not recover for those dmgs. This rule also limits a breaching party's liability for consequnetial dmgs that P could've avoided (lost profits) by obtaining a R comparable substitute performance. In a sales of goods K, art 2 calls this "cover" (#3p13)(03:44:00)

P - non-economic damages such as PAIN and suffering, emotional distress, or loss of reputation because of breach

    rare exceptions in K's involving decedent's body and breach of K

S - SPECULATIVE damages are not recoverable. K law, like tort law, requires any resulting damages must be proven with R certainty

a newly opened business frequently has trouble proving lost profits. there is no per se rule, but courts are reluctant to reqard lost profit damages to a new business because of absence of financial records to support lost profit claim

when a K has been breached, there are 3 types of dmgs that a P may seek to recover:

1. Restitution Damages - seek to recover the value of any benefit bestowed on the breaching party by a part performance. EX: return of a buyer's deposit. Restitution does not seek to enforce a K, seeks to prevent unjust enrichment by compensating the P for value of part-performance(services or $)
2. Reliance Damages - similar to restitution but are out-of-pocket expenses wasted by P's reliance on the breached K. These dmgs are recoverable provided they were foreseeable by the parties. Reliance dmgs dek to pay back P for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in getting ready to perform K. It seeks to put the non-breaching party in as good a position as if the K had not been entered. Does not include lost profits. EX: seller breaches real property K must compensate buyer for reliance dmgs for buyer's cost of survey, soil testing, and the cost of title search
3. Expectation Damages - seek to recover the benefit of the bargain which is the profit P would've made w/o breach. These dmgs, also called consequential dmgs, in a UCC sale of goods K, seek to place P in same financial position she would've been in  if K had been fully performed.
